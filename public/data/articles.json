      "content":"Dots Per Inch and Pixels Per Inch, DPI and PPI respectively, are units for measuring the tiny bits of color that come together to form a printed image or an image on a screen. The higher the density of those dots or pixels, the higher the resolution. For most, a rudimentary understanding of DPI or PPI amounts to knowing whether or not an image is clear but small enough to print, email, or post to social media. However, for designers, understanding screen density and ratio is essential to delivering delightful user experiences across devices. Designing for phones, tablets, laptops, watches, and hybrids without a proper knowledge of dpi and ratio is a lot like building a house using the wrong measurement — things are going to look very weird very quickly (and good luck getting through the door!)."

We hosted FORM, Google’s first-ever design conference in San Francisco and engaged in numerous outreach efforts through workshops, design sprints, and online discussions. We’ve continued to improve and expand on the material design guidelines and have witnessed countless teams both inside and outside Google adopt the framework and ship beautiful, materialized products across platforms. To better capture all this great design work happening at Google and around the community, we’ve completely reconceived Google Design. In addition to all the guidelines and resources you’ve come to rely on, we’ve also released guides for TV, Auto, and Cardboard, our virtual reality product. Our new Icon Library allows you to download our icon font and source from the over 800 material system icons. We’ve also added a whole new layer of written and video content — everything from tutorials, case-studies, interviews, and essays, to a listing of job opportunities and design-related events, like our upcoming FORM conference. The goal is to provide a new perspective on our design process and ample opportunity for cross pollination. Now you can watch an animated color tutorial before you dive into the nitty gritty details in our material design guidelines, or get some practical guidance around designing between platforms. Our Making Material Design series takes you behind-the-scenes to find out what it takes to create a new visual framework for Google. Additionally, we’ve launched new Dribbble and YouTube channels to complement our active Twitter and Google+ presence and can share even more real-time content from our design teams. We hope you enjoy the the new Google Design, and we look forward to hearing your feedback on Twitter and Google+. After all, good design is never done."
